# Technologies Used

## Frontend
- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing you to create dynamic and responsive web applications. I chose React because it enables fast, modular, and reusable UI components, making development more efficient and scalable.
- **Redux**: A state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React to manage the application's state in a predictable way. I used Redux to manage the global state of my application, ensuring consistency and enabling easy debugging across complex state transitions.
- **CSS (Tailwind CSS)**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed classes to help you quickly build custom designs without writing custom CSS. Tailwind CSS was chosen for its flexibility and ease of use, enabling rapid development of responsive and customizable designs without bloating the CSS.

## Backend
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine, used for building scalable and high-performance server-side applications. Node.js was selected because of its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which is ideal for handling a large number of concurrent requests, making it perfect for building fast and scalable web applications.
- **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of robust APIs and web applications by providing a set of useful tools and features. Express.js was used because it streamlines backend development with its simple and flexible routing system, allowing for the rapid creation of RESTful APIs.

## Database
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. Itâ€™s known for its scalability and ease of use, making it ideal for modern web applications with large and varied data. MongoDB was chosen because it offers high flexibility for evolving data structures, supports horizontal scaling, and is well-suited for handling unstructured data at scale.

## Tools
- **Docker**: A platform used to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Docker ensures that your application runs the same way across different environments, whether in development, testing, or production. I used Docker to streamline deployment, making it easier to package and distribute my application, ensuring consistency across environments and simplifying the scaling of my infrastructure on AWS.
